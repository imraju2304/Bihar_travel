Madhubani painting has become synonymous with art and craft of Bihar in the whole world.

</p>

<p>

The process of painting and the use of natural dyes and pigments provide an eye-catching finish to these paintings. Traditionally, the painting was done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts; but over the years it has moved to varied mediums including cloths, handmade papers, and canvas. Madhubani Painting is done with fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks, using natural dyes and pigments, and is characterized by eye-catching geometrical patterns. This is a unique craft, handcrafted by artisans. Madhubani Painting provides livelihood support to about 20000-25000 artisan’s family on regular basis in Madhubani district and other places of Bihar.

	Patna, the capital city of Bihar.Situated on the southern bank of Ganga, Patna is the largest city of Bihar. Better known as Patliputra in ancient India, the city is also believed to be the one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Patna is a pilgrimage for Sikh devotees as it is reckoned to be the birthplace of last Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. The city flourished in the period of Haryanka, Nanda, Mauryan, Shunga, Gupta and Pala earned fame all across India. Today’s Patna is a developing city, which is endeavouring to match up to the modernization; malls, high-end hotels and theatres have cropped in the city. However, Patna has to speed up a bit to become the part of other cosmopolitans. Altogether, Patna is a decent destination, with most of the modern facilities available.

					Probably the oldest university in India, Nalanda is an important site to visit in Bihar. A perfect reminisce to the time of flourishing Gupta and Pala period, Nalanda is an acclaimed tourist attraction in Bihar. It is believed that the last and most famous Jain Tirthankara, Mahavira spent 14 monsoon seasons here. Even, Buddha is said to have delivered lectures near the mango grove in Nalanda. The fame of this education centre was to an extent that Hieun Tsang, the famous Chinese traveller visited here and stayed for atleast two years here. Even, I-tsing another famous Chinese voyager stayed at Nalanda for about 10 years, AND such was the glory of this place. Today most parts of Nalanda lie in ruins but the place is surely worth exploring!

				<h2> Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary, Begusarai </h2>
<img src="C:\Users\91987\Pictures\images\kanwar-lake-bird-sanctuary.jpg" height="700" width="100%">
				
				<p>
					Kanwar Lake is India’s largest freshwater Oxbow lake. Situated in Begusarai, Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary is reckoned to be the haven for 60 species of migratory birds. Unfortunately, this place is losing its importance due negligence, in a Wetland Governance in South Asia, held in Delhi in 2014, the condition of this wetland ecosystem was discussed. We hope that some careful steps are taken for this bird sanctuary that has been a home to many birds both domestic and migratory.

Barabar Hills consists of 4 caves, whereas Nagarjuni Hills have 3 caves, each of the cave are well-polished and have articulate designs and inscriptions over its walls and ceilings.
